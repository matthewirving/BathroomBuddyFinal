# Bathroom Buddy
The Bathroom Buddy is an innovative and new product that solves some of the biggest and most important questions in our daily lives: who is in the bathroom, and how long have they been in there? No longer do you have to physically get up, go to the bathroom, knock on the door, ask who is in the bathroom, and then yell at them to hurry up. Now you can perform all these tasks virtually from the comfort and leisure of your own bed, desk, or working area.

The Bathroom Buddy is an ESP32 set to Station Mode that hosts a very crudely made website on our wifi network that can "accurately" display the time both on a small 4 segment 7 digit display and any internet capable device connected to the wifi.
